The Media and Democracy Data Cooperative (MDDC, pronounced "medic") is a collaborative effort across multiple research centers to advance research using digital data, particularly in the areas of political media and communication. MDDC's mission has two pillars: (1) to advance digital data collection efforts and (2) to provide opportunities for collaborative research across our members.
