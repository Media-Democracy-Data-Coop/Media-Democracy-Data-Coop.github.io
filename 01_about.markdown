The Media and Democracy Data Cooperative (MDDC) is a multi-disciplinary network of research centers and researchers working together to advance the use of digital data in political media and communication scholarship.  

MDDC's mission rests on two pillars: (1) to advance digital data collection efforts and (2) to provide opportunities for members to work together on research projects and endeavors.  

In addition to facilitating collaborative research about digital data, the MDDC also organizes annual events to bring together researchers studying the digital media ecology.
