The 2022 Digital Data Conference (D2C) will take place from Thursday and Friday, April 14-15, 2022. D2C is generously sponsored by the [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/).

**Organizing committee**: Jo Lukito (UT-Austin), Yunkang Yang (GWU), Jordan Foley (WSU), Sang Jung Kim (UW-Madison), Ross Dahlke (Stanford), and Meghann Norden-Bright (SSRC)

The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers collecting and analyzing digital media data to discuss both the practice and ethics of digital data research. The conference consists of both public and invited activities.  

On the **first day (April 14)**, we will focus on data collection tools and strategies, which will include demonstrations of tools and discussions about database management.  




On the **second day (April 15)**, we will focus on digital data ethics, including privacy and fairness issues.
