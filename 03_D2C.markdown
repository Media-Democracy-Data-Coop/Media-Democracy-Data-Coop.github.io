Digital media are constantly changing. Unsurprisingly, this means that research using digital media data also changes. In an effort to capture the trends in digital media data research, the Media & Democracy Data Cooperative is releasing this 2023 report on the State of Digital Media Data Research, highlighting the key challenges that digital media data (DMD) researchers face. The report is also a call to action for greater collaboration, transparency, preparation, and consistency within the interdisciplinary and growing DMD research community.

This report synthesizes the opinions and experiences of the data cooperative, as well as insights from the 2022 Digital Data Conference (D2C, see below). 

This work was supported by the Social Science Research Council.
